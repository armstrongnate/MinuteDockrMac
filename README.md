## Setup
1. Clone or download zip
2. Open `MinuteDockrMac.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. `Cmd+R` to build and run

After you build you can drag and drop `MinuteDockerMac.app` into your Applications directory so you can run the app without having Xcode running in the background. That file will probably be in the Products directory inside the Xcode Project Navigator panel.
